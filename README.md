# My First Java Repository: Basic Calculator Application

## Description:
This repository contains a simple yet functional **Java-based console calculator** application. It allows users to perform various mathematical operations interactively. Designed as an entry-level Java project, it demonstrates essential programming concepts such as user input handling, method creation, and loop structures.  

## Key Features:
1. **Mathematical Operations:**  
   - **Addition:** Supports multiple numbers until the user types "stop."  
   - **Subtraction:** Handles successive subtraction of numbers.  
   - **Multiplication:** Allows multiplying several numbers interactively.  
   - **Division:** Computes the result of dividing two numbers with precision.  
   - **Square Root:** Finds the square root of a given number.  
   - **N-th Root:** Calculates the N-th root of a specified number.  

2. **Input Validation:**  
   - Ensures valid inputs and guides users with error messages for invalid entries.  
   - Allows users to stop input for operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication by typing "stop."  

3. **Reusability:**  
   - Implements modular design with separate methods for each operation.  
   - Ensures code readability and ease of maintenance.  

4. **Error-Free Execution:**  
   - Handles edge cases like invalid inputs and division by zero gracefully.  

## Technologies Used:
- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **Development Environment:** Any IDE or text editor supporting Java (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code).  

## Outcome:
This project provided hands-on experience in:  
- Understanding Java fundamentals such as loops, conditionals, and methods.  
- Implementing modular and reusable code practices.  
- Gaining confidence in creating interactive console-based applications.
